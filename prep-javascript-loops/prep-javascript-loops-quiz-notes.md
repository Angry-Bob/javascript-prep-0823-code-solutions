- What is the purpose of the **condition** expression in the `for` and `while` loops?
  3 optional expressions that are evaluated an determine the length of a program run time.
- When is the first expression in the parentheses for a `for` loop (known as the **initialization**) evaluated?
  The initialization is to set any variables that need to be set
- When is the second expression in the parentheses for a `for` loop (known as the **condition**) evaluated?
  The condition is to check for truthyness throughout the running of the for loop
- When is the third expression in the parentheses for a `for` loop (known as the **final expression**) evaluated?
  It is evaluated only if the second condition remains true. Once the condition if false the third condition ceases to be observed
